Quick instructions how to build smash.

Prerequisites
-------------

SMASH is known to compile and work with one of these compilers (which have the
required C++11 features):
- gcc >= 4.8
- clang >= 3.2

It requires the following tools & libraries:
- cmake
- the GNU Scientific Library.
- boost filesystem >= 1.49
- yaml-cpp 0.5.1 (see below if you need to install manually)

Further tools that can be helpful (mainly for development):
- ROOT
- doxygen
- valgrind
- cpplint
- cppcheck

Building SMASH
--------------

Build it in a separate directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make

Run it with specific settings:

    vi config.yaml
    ./smash



Changing the compiler
---------------------

In order to use a particular compiler, you can set the following environment
variables:

    export CC=gcc
    export CXX=g++



Compiling with ROOT support
---------------------------

In order to produce ROOT output with SMASH,
you need a working installation of ROOT.

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

Build the code documentation:

    make doc

Build the user documentation:

    make user


Running Tests
-------------

Run the various unit tests:

    make test

Another way to do this is:

    ctest


This has the advantage that it can also be used for running tests in parallel on
a multicore machine, e.g. via

    ctest -j4

(on a quad-core machine).


Installing yaml-cpp manually
----------------------------

- get the yaml-cpp tarball

      wget http://yaml-cpp.googlecode.com/files/yaml-cpp-0.5.1.tar.gz

- unpack

      tar -xf yaml-cpp-0.5.1.tar.gz

- build in a build directory

      cd yaml-cpp-0.5.1
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[prefix] -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
      make
      make install

  Replace [prefix] above with the place where you want to install yaml-cpp. You
  can e.g. install it to $HOME.
- If you did not install you a standard location you'll need to set the
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable for SMASH to find it:

      export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=[prefix]/lib/pkgconfig
